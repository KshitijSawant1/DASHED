# DASHED Code Editor: AI-Assisted Multi-Language DSA Practice Platform

## Overview

This project is an AI-assisted online code editor designed to help students practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in a guided, educational manner.

Unlike traditional coding platforms that only mark answers as right or wrong, this system focuses on learning through hints. It analyzes student-written code, detects conceptual and logical mistakes, and provides progressive, non-revealing hints generated by an AI tutor grounded in curated knowledge.

The system is language-aware, rule-driven, and AI-assisted, with a backend that remains the single source of truth for correctness.

## Key Design Philosophy

*Backend decides facts.
AI explains facts.
RAG supplies allowed knowledge.*

#### This separation ensures

- Deterministic correctness
- No AI hallucinations
- No solution leakage
- Strong educational value

---

## Target Users

#### Primary Users

- Undergraduate engineering students
- Beginners learning DSA
- Students preparing for coding interviews
- Learners transitioning from theory to implementation

#### Secondary Users

- Educators and teaching assistants
- Institutions building internal coding labs
- Hackathon / workshop participants

---

## Core Features

#### 4.1. Code Editor

- Online editor with syntax highlighting
- Language selection (Python initially)
- Supports incomplete and partial code

#### 4.2. Hint System (Primary Feature)

- Student clicks Hint
- System analyzes code without executing it
- Detects the most relevant mistake
- Generates a single, guided hint
- Supports progressive hint levels

==**No solutions are ever shown.**==

#### 4.3. Run & Evaluation System

- Student clicks Run
- Code is executed in a secure sandbox
- Outputs compared against test cases
- Verdict generated:
  - Incorrect
  - Partially Correct
  - Correct
  - Correct but Optimizable
  - Optional AI explanation of verdict (no code)



#### 4.4. AI Tutor (Explanation Only)

- AI does not judge correctness
- AI does not analyze raw code
- AI only converts backend diagnosis into human-readable guidance


#### 4.5. RAG-Based Knowledge Grounding

- AI is restricted to retrieved, curated knowledge
- Prevents hallucinations and off-syllabus explanations
- Ensures consistency across hints

## Language Strategy (Present & Future)

#### 6.1 Python (Initial Implementation)

Python is the first supported language due to:

- Built-in AST support
- Rapid prototyping
- Ease of static analysis

Python Capabilities
- AST-based structural analysis
- Detection of:
- Missing logic
- Incorrect mutations
- Logical errors
  - Incomplete implementations
  - Secure execution for Run

#### 6.2 Future Languages: C and Java (Designed-in)

##### The system is designed to scale using a Language Adapter Pattern.

- **C Adapter**
  - Parsing: Tree-sitter (C)
  - Execution: gcc + sandbox
- **Java Adapter**
  - Parsing: Tree-sitter (Java) / JavaParser
  - Execution: javac + JVM sandbox

##### All languages are normalized into a common Intermediate Representation (IR), ensuring:

- Shared mistake rules
- Shared RAG knowledge
- No duplicated logic

--- 

## Unified Intermediate Representation (IR)

Instead of language-specific logic, all code is converted into IR concepts such as:

- ASSIGN
- MUTATE
- CALL
- LOOP
- RECURSION
- RETURN

This allows one rule to work across:
- Python
- C
- Java

## Mistake Detection Engine

For each DSA problem, the backend defines:

- Expected behavior rules
- Common mistake patterns

**==Mistakes are pattern-based, not exact-code-based.==**

#### Example

```
Problem: Stack.push
Pattern: Container reassigned
Mistake ID: M1
```

The backend defines the following rules:

- Expected behavior
- Common mistake patterns

---

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

RAG provides contextual educational knowledge to the AI tutor.

#### Stored Knowledge Includes

- Problem statements
- Concept explanations
- Expected approaches (no full solutions)
- Time & space complexity notes
- Common misconceptions

#### RAG Will Not Store

- Student code
- Full answers
- Test cases

---

## AI Layer (LLM)

#### Model Strategy

- Locally hosted LLM using Ollama
- Recommended models:
  - llama3:8b
  - mistral:7b

#### AI Responsibilities

- Generate one hint at a time
- Use only RAG-provided context
- Adapt explanation to:
  - Student level
  - Hint level

#### AI Restrictions

- No code generation
- No solution hints
- No correctness decisions

---

## Tech Stack

#### Frontend

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Monaco Editor (VS Code editor)
- REST-based backend communication
  
#### Backend

- FastAPI (Python)
- Language Router & Adapters
- Rule-based analysis engine

#### Static Analysis

- Python AST (initial)
- Tree-sitter (C, Java – future)

#### AI & RAG

- Ollama (local LLM)
- ChromaDB or FAISS (vector database)
- Embedding model (lightweight)

#### Execution Sandbox

- Python restricted interpreter
- gcc sandbox (future)
- JVM sandbox (future)

---

## Security & Safety Considerations

- No AI-based correctness judgments
- No direct AI access from frontend
- Strict sandboxing for code execution
- Output validation for AI responses
- Context-limited AI prompts

---

## Scope Management

#### In Scope (v1)

- Python-only DSA problems
- Rule-based mistake detection
- RAG-based hint generation
- Ollama-powered AI tutor

#### Out of Scope (v1)

- Full solution generation
- Large-scale multi-user concurrency
- Online judge-scale infrastructure

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add C and Java adapters

---

## One-Line Summary

> A rule-driven, AI-assisted DSA learning platform where correctness is deterministic, hints are pedagogical, and AI is strictly constrained to teach—not solve.

---

## Final Takeaway

*This project is not an AI model.
It is a well-engineered AI system.*

#### Where intelligence is backed by

- Strong backend design
- Language-agnostic analysis
- Controlled use of AI
- Grounded educational context
